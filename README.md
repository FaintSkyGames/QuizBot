# Quiz Bot
Quiz Bot is a Discord bot designed to track scores during weekly quizzes. It provides an efficient way to store and manage quiz results using a database, ensuring fair and accurate scorekeeping among participants.

## Features
- **Score Tracking:** Automatically records and updates quiz scores based on message reactions.
- **Database Storage:** Uses MongoDB Atlas to store quiz data securely.
- **Participant Tracking:** Keeps a record of all players who participate in the quizzes.
- **Winner Announcement:** Identifies and announces the winner at the end of each quiz.
- **Host Selection:** Allows for the designation of a quiz host to manage the session.

## Technologies Used
Quiz Bot leverages modern tools and frameworks to streamline development and ensure maintainability:
- **Discord.js:** A powerful JavaScript library for interacting with the Discord API.
- **Mongoose:** An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
- **MongoDB Atlas:** A cloud-hosted MongoDB database for seamless data management.
- **Discobase:** A utility package that simplifies database interactions for Discord bots.
Additionally, ChatGPT was used solely to assist in writing this README, ensuring clarity and professionalism.

## Installation & Setup (Coming Soon)
Currently, there are no setup instructions available. However, future updates will include a step-by-step guide to running the bot locally and deploying it to the cloud.

## Hosting & Deployment
During development, the bot is currently running locally, while the database is hosted remotely on MongoDB Atlas. This setup allows for efficient local testing while ensuring persistent and secure storage of quiz data in the cloud.

## Future Plans
As development progresses, several key improvements are planned for Quiz Bot:
- **Cloud Deployment:** Transition from local hosting to a cloud-based service for 24/7 availability.
- **Web-Based Leaderboard:** Develop a web interface displaying quiz scores with customizable themes.
These enhancements will improve functionality, accessibility, and user experience for the server quiz sessions.

## Contributions & Feedback
At this stage, the project is private and primarily for the CGD server. However, contributions and feedback are always welcome for future improvements.

## License
This project does not have an open-source license at this time.
