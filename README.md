## Installation & Setup (Coming Soon)
Currently, there are no setup instructions available. However, future updates will include a step-by-step guide to running the bot locally and deploying it to the cloud.

## Hosting & Deployment
During development, the bot is currently running locally, while the database is hosted remotely on MongoDB Atlas. This setup allows for efficient local testing while ensuring persistent and secure storage of quiz data in the cloud.

## Future Plans
As development progresses, several key improvements are planned for Quiz Bot:
- **Cloud Deployment:** Transition from local hosting to a cloud-based service for 24/7 availability.
- **Web-Based Leaderboard:** Develop a web interface displaying quiz scores with customizable themes.
These enhancements will improve functionality, accessibility, and user experience for the server quiz sessions.
